## Blog

When adding or updating a blog post, always update these files:

1. The blog post HTML file in `blog/` (create or edit)
2. `blog/index.html` -- add or update the post entry in the post list (newest first)
3. `blog/feed.xml` -- add or update the `<item>` entry in the RSS feed (newest first). Use RFC 2822 date format for `<pubDate>` (e.g. `Wed, 11 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000`)
